<h3>First Trimester: Changes in a Woman's Daily Routine</h3><br>
Some of the changes you experience in your first trimester may cause you to revise your daily routine. You may need to go to bed earlier or eat more frequent or smaller meals. Some women experience a lot of discomfort, and others may not feel any at all. Each pregnancy is different and even if you've been pregnant before you may feel completely different with each subsequent pregnancy.
