        Newborn babies keep their parents on their toes! There is always something to keep mom or dad in a state of worry. Common health concerns in newborn babies include skin conditions, eye problems, infections, fever, behaviour changes, spitting up and vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation.

        <h2>Routine Care at Home</h2>
        <p>Your newborn baby is not nearly as fragile as you might think. However, you should still handle your newborn baby gently, not just for safety, but also to keep him feeling safe and secure. Choose wisely when you buy outfits for your baby. Avoid turtlenecks, skin-tight sleeves, multitudes of buttons, and zippers down the back. Don’t make the process more difficult than it has to be.<br>
        It is helpful to have all the diaper paraphernalia on hand before attempting to change your newborn baby. Try to keep all the necessary items in one place close to where you and your baby spend a lot of your time. Things to keep on hand include baby wipes, a change pad, diapers, and ointment or petroleum jelly.<br></p>

        <h2>Feeding and Nutrition</h2>
        <p>It is universally accepted that human breast milk is the best source of nutrition for newborn babies and infants. Breastfeeding also has many non-nutritive benefits that lead to the best health and development of the baby. According to the World Health Organization, “exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months is the optimal way of feeding infants. Thereafter, infants should receive complementary foods with continued breastfeeding up to two years of age or beyond.”<br>
            <br>
        Numerous studies have shown the benefits of providing human milk to newborn babies and young infants, which include better tolerance of feeding, reduced gastrointestinal disease, and improved intelligence. In developing countries, breastfeeding results in lower infant mortality.<br></p>

    <div>
        <h2>Breastfeeding</h2>
        <p>Breast milk is the perfect food for babies. Breastfeeding is recommended for the first six months of life and beyond with the addition of complementary solid foods starting at six months of age. Not only does breast milk have the right nutritional balance for your baby, but it also contains growth factors, antibodies, and other mechanisms that protect your baby against infections and other diseases throughout his lifetime.<br><br>
            Newborn babies should be encouraged to go to the breast within half an hour of birth, usually while still in the delivery room.   In the first few minutes after birth, if your newborn baby is placed in skin-to-skin contact on your chest, and his arms and legs are free to move, he will maneuver towards your nipple, just like all newborn mammals in their quest to survive. Your newborn baby may decide to suck right away or, more likely, he may be interested in gazing into your eyes first.   Depending on the size of your breast or the length of your delivery, your newborn baby might need a bit of assistance to reach your nipple. After going through a few different stages of alertness ranging from quiet awake to alert to drowsy, your newborn baby may fall into a deep sleep. After a few hours, he will awaken for his next feeding.<br></p>
