    <img src="images/second.jpg" class="center">
    <div>
    Some changes you may notice in your body in the second trimester include:
</div>
    <div>
<ul>
<li>Back, abdomen, groin, or thigh aches and pains</li>
<li>Stretch marks on your abdomen, breasts, thighs, or buttocks</li>
<li>Darkening of the skin around your nipples</li>
<li>A line on the skin running from belly button to pubic hairline (linea nigra)</li>
<li>Patches of darker skin, usually over the cheeks, forehead, nose, or upper lip. This is sometimes called the mask of pregnancy (melasma, or Chloasma facies).</li>
<li>Numb or tingling hands (carpal tunnel syndrome)</li>
<li>Itching on the abdomen, palms, and soles of the feet. (Call your doctor if you have nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, yellowing of skin, or fatigue combined with itching. These can be signs of a liver problem.)</li>
<li>Swelling of the ankles, fingers, and face. (If you notice any sudden or extreme swelling or if you gain a lot of weight quickly, call your doctor immediately. This could be a sign of a serious condition called preeclampsia.)</li>
</ul>

<li>Skin begins to form and is nearly translucent.</li>
<li>Meconium develops in your baby's intestinal tract. This will be your baby's first bowel movement.</li>
<li>Your baby begins sucking motions with the mouth (sucking reflex).</li>
<li>Your baby is about 4 to 5 inches long and weighs almost 3 ounces.</li>
</ul>
</div>

    At about 20 weeks in the second trimester, your baby continues to develop:
<ul>
<li>Your baby is more active. You might feel movement or kicking.</li>
<li>Your baby is covered by fine, feathery hair called lanugo and a waxy protective coating called vernix.</li>
<li>Eyebrows, eyelashes, fingernails, and toenails have formed. Your baby can even scratch itself.</li>
<li>Your baby can hear and swallow.</li>
<li>Now halfway through your pregnancy, your baby is about 6 inches long and weighs about 9 ounces.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Second Trimester: The Baby at 24 Weeks</h3>

<div>
    By 24 weeks, even more changes occur for your growing baby:
<ul>
<li>The baby's bone marrow begins to make blood cells.</li>
<li>Taste buds form on your baby's tongue.</li>
<li>Footprints and fingerprints have formed.</li>
<li>Hair begins to grow on your baby's head.</li>
<li>The lungs are formed, but do not yet work.</li>
<li>Your baby has a regular sleep cycle.</li>
<li>If your baby is a boy, his testicles begin to descend into the scrotum. If your baby is a girl, her uterus and ovaries are in place, and a lifetime supply of eggs has formed in the ovaries.</li>
<li>Your baby stores fat and weighs about 1Â½ pounds, and is 12 inches long.</li>
</ul>
