    <h3>Third Trimester: Changes a Woman May Experience</h3>
    <img src="images/third.jpg" class="center">
    The third trimester is the final stage of pregnancy. Discomforts that started in the second trimester will likely continue, along with some new ones. As the baby grows and puts more pressure on your internal organs, you may find you have difficulty breathing and have to urinate more frequently. This is normal and once you give birth these problems should go away.

        At 32 weeks in the third trimester, your baby's development continues:
<ul>
<li>Your baby's bones are soft but fully formed.</li>
<li>Movements and kicking increase.</li>
<li>The eyes can open and close.</li>
<li>Lungs are not fully formed, but practice "breathing" movements occur.</li>
<li>Your baby's body begins to store vital minerals, such as iron and calcium.</li>
<li>Lanugo (fine hair) begins to fall off.</li>
<li>Your baby is gaining about ½ pound a week, weighs about 4 to 4½ pounds, and is about 15 to 17 inches long.</li>
</ul>

    At 36 weeks, as your due date approaches, your baby continues development:
<ul>
<li>The protective waxy coating (vernix) thickens.</li>
<li>Body fat increases.</li>
<li>Your baby is getting bigger and has less space to move around. Movements are less forceful, but you will still feel them.</li>

</div>

    Finally, from 37 to 40 weeks the last stages of your baby's development occur:
<ul>
<li>By the end of 37 weeks, your baby is considered full term.</li>
<li>Your baby's organs are capable of functioning on their own.</li>
<li>As you near your due date, your baby may turn into a head-down position for birth.</li>
<li>Average birth weight is between 6 pounds, 2 ounces to 9 pounds, 2 ounces and average length is 19 to 21 inches long. Most full-term babies fall within these ranges, but healthy babies come in many different weights and sizes.</li>
</ul>
